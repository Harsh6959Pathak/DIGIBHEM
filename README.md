# DIGIBHEM
Project Goal: To create a simple game that is fun to play and that demonstrates the ability to use
Java to create user interfaces, handle input and output, and implement basic game logic.
Project Scope: The project will create a simple text-based game that allows the user to play against
the computer. The game will be a simple guessing game where the user tries to guess a number
between 1 and 100. The computer will randomly generate a number, and the user will have 10
guesses to guess the correct number. The game will keep track of the user score and display it at the
end of the game.
Project Methodology:
1. The first step will be to design the game. This includes deciding on the game mechanics, the user
interface, and the scoring system.
2. The next step will be to implement the game. This includes writing the code for the game logic, the
user interface, and the scoring system.
3. The video can be hosted on LinkedIn for proof of your work and build credibility
among your peers . You can tag Digital Bhem in such posts.
4. Please add #digitalbhem in each of your task video postings on LinkedIn,
Additionally, you can also add hashtags such as #internship #webdevelopment,
#androiddevelopment, #pythonprogramming etc. depending on your internship
domain for more reach and visibility.

2. Movie Selection: Users can browse a list of available movies, view movie details such as title,
genre, duration, and ratings, and select the desired movie to book tickets.
Introduction
The Movie Ticket Booking System is a Java-based application designed to provide users with the
ability to select and book movie tickets. The system allows users to choose seats, manage multiple
theaters and showtimes, and ensures ticket availability. By implementing seat selection algorithms
and robust management features, this system aims to enhance the movie ticket booking process for
users.
Features
The Movie Ticket Booking System includes the following features:

3. Theater Selection: Users can choose from a list of available theaters where the selected movie is
1. User Registration: Users can create accounts and register their personal details to facilitate future
bookings and access additional functionalities.
3. The third step will be to test the game. This includes playing the game yourself and testing all of the
game features.
4. The final step will be to deploy the game. This includes making the game available to users.
‚óè The project team will thoroughly test the game before deploying it.
